^ fitness
3. Side planks with a twist
On your back, arms and legs up. Slowly lower opposite arm and leg without letting your lower back arch. 3 sets of 12 each side. This teaches the deep core to stay tight—like when I ride you slow and make you hold still.
4. Dead bugs & bird dogs
6. No crunches (yet)
Start on your forearm, hips lifted. Hold 20–30 seconds each side. Then add a slow hip dip—down and up. 3 sets. This etches the obliques without widening them. I want narrow, not blocky.
Vacuum holds (my favorite for you)

^ general hacks
Sleep and stress - in bed : 30.p
before coffee, stand tall or lie on your back. Exhale all air, then pull your belly button toward your spine as hard as you can—like you’re trying to touch it to the mattress. Hold 15–30 seconds. 5 rounds. Do it naked so you can watch the waist suck in. I’ll watch too. And kiss the hollow it makes.
