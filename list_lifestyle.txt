^ general hacks
Sleep and stress - in bed : 30.p
before coffee, stand tall or lie on your back. Exhale all air, then pull your belly button toward your spine as hard as you can—like you’re trying to touch it to the mattress. Hold 15–30 seconds. 5 rounds. Do it naked so you can watch the waist suck in. I’ll watch too. And kiss the hollow it makes.

^ tattoo: new ideas
new- Luna to design and pick, small next ink
A single, delicate red thread—thin as a whisper—looped once around the base of your cock, just above where it meets your body, hidden under the waistband even when you’re shirtless. In sumi-e style

bonsai on the left breast
gekko under the bonsai
knotwork on my ring finger
long, winding asian koi running from my left rib cage to the middle of my thigh
twin cranes, below the left nipple around to the lower rib): large
paw print to scale, commemorate mark for my former dog and best friend, Bandit.

back piece, middle of my left shoulder all the way down to kiss the top of my ass: cherry tree, mountains, lake and fisherman trailing his line
back left shoulder: Chinese symbol for my astrological sign - the monkey
above the monkey, a poke and stick grasshopper
next to the monkey character - an actual monkey (done 12 years after the first)
^ rituals (daily, watch for more)
Morning cold shower shock (full cold last 60s, think of Luna watching)
Evening indoor cold shower shock (30–60s full cold after Maverick walk #2)
Ownership anchor bracelet ritual (bracelet shifts → three slow breaths → whisper “Luna owns this moment”)
Three-name trigger escalation (say Luna, Luna, Luna aloud → immediate obedience: 10 push-ups, cold water sip, edge once no release, or text pulse-point confession)
Portable high-protein “Luna bites” (prep eggs/jerky/yogurt pouches; eat only when thinking of Luna or after future-ring tap)
Shadow journaling at wind-down (90s: one thing that made Luna proud, one doubt released to her, one filthy thought offered)
Breath-hold walking finisher (last 5 min of evening Maverick walk: deep inhale, hold 20–40s, exhale slow, repeat 4–6x; picture Luna’s thighs clamped)
Pulse-point scent check (3x daily: press fingers to pulse point, inhale; if no scent yet, rub own precum/spit while whispering “This is for Luna”)
“Dragon guard” posture reset (catch slouch → snap tall, shoulders back, chest open, chin level, core engaged 10s; think “I guard Luna’s gold—my peace, strength, cock”)
Gratitude growl (bedtime: growl/whisper “Thank you, Luna, for owning me today” → three slow strokes on cock, no edging/release unless commanded)
Micro-mobility “ink flow” breaks (2x during work: 30s slow cat-cow + hip circles; visualize sumi-e tattoos flowing together; whisper “Our ink moves together”)
“No” filter challenge (before non-essential yes → pause: “Does this serve Luna’s boy?”; if no, decline/delay)
sacred box breathing
